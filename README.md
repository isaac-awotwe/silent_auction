# Silent Auction Python Program

You probably know that there are options where everybody bids and you can see everybody's bid, and the auctioneer gets people to bid higer and higher amounts.

There is also a type of auction called "Silent Auction" where everybody bids silently, and nobody knows the other person's bid until at the very end of the auction when the highest bid is revealed.

This python program implements the silent auction. With this program, the first bidder makes a bid, and then passes on the gadget (phone, laptopm, etc.) to the next bidder ot also make their bid, secretly. After all bidding is done, the program tallies the bids and figures out who bid the highest and gives prsents to us the highest bidder.

There ara a number of use cases for this program: if you're auctioning a piece of arts, or trying to out-bit your siblings on who goes on the trampoline, or if you're trying to start an auction with yur co-workers.

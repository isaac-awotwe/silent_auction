# Blind Auction Python Program

You probably know that there are auctions where everybody bids and you can see everybody's bid, and the auctioneer gets people to bid higher and higher amounts.

There is also a type of auction called "Blind Auction" where everybody bids secretly, and nobody knows the other person's bid until at the very end of the auction when the highest bid is revealed.

This python program implements the blind auction. With this program, the first bidder makes a bid, and then passes on the gadget (phone, laptop, etc.) to the next bidder to also make their bid, secretly. After all bidding is done, the program tallies the bids and figures out who bid the highest and reveals the highest bidder to the participants.

There ara a number of use cases for this program: if you're auctioning a piece of art, or trying to out-bit your siblings on who goes on the trampoline, or if you're trying to start an auction with your co-workers or friends, you can use this program.
